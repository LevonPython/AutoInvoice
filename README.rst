Introduction
============
Automation of E-Invoicing program.
In short, AutoInvoice v1.2 does almost **everything instead of users**.

The application is written in python. App's users are accountants and accounting companies.
Python scripts were converted to **C** code via cython static compiler, which made code more secure.

============
Problems the application is solving
============
Many accountants log in to the E-invoicing program every day, export  received / written invoices from the previous day (days) or any other day in **xml**, **excel**, **pdf** formats, import them to ArmSoft Accountant database or do other jobs with them.
Of course, it's a boring and tedious daily job.
AutoInvoice is quite able to perform these actions and not only.

============
Advantages
============

   All necessary information
- Users can run the accounts of many organizations, it is possible to use an unlimited number of organizations
- Users can get opportunity to use the application for free to make sure in efficiency.
- The application allows users to export an unlimited amount of information
   - in *xml*,
   - in *csv* or *xlsx (excel)*,
   - in *pdf*
   - Export for a *monthly period*
   - Export for *days of the month*
   - Export in *several selected months*
   - *annual* export
